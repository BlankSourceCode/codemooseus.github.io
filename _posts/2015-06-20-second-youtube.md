After my first successful youtube upload. I decided to do it all again!

But this time I recorded a video for my second set of animated sprites, the "mini-monsters".

I used the same unity scene that I had created before for the heroes, only I swapped out the images for my new sprites. Which is actually easier said than done, since you can't just target a unity animation to a different spritesheet (without custom code anyway). So I ended up just remaking all the animations (which isn't too hard, you just drag and drop the frames and rename them).

Anyway, here is the second upload to youtube showing you the animations for my monsters:
