After the longest wait (not really but it felt like it), my second set of animated sprites are now available onÂ [http://gamedevmarket.net](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/rpg-pixel-sprites-mini-monsters-2666/)

If you saw the youtube video already you'll know what to expect, but I still think its cool that you can check them out on a real world store.
