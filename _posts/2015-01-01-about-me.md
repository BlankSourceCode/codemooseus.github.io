Hello there and thanks for coming to check out my about page!

I suppose you’re here to read all about the fascinating explanation of who I am, what I do, and why I have a website dedicated to it. Imagine the possibilities! It could be a legend filled with adventure, intrigue, long lost love, and treasure!  Or perhaps the story begins on a dark and stormy night where the first full moon of spring hangs lifeless in the sky, and a newly turned werewolf howls in the far away distance. Or better yet, what if the tale starts just as a young boy receives an unexpected letter? One that promises an introduction to a world filled with magic, wizards, and dangerous dragons.

Unfortunately, the truth is just not that exciting.

I’m just your average full-time developer. I work at a large corporation by day, but by night? Oh ho! Well… Mostly I just sleep.
However I do have a keen interest in indie game development and most recently, the stunning world of pixel art.

And to that end I’ve set aside some of my spare time in order to teach myself a few tricks to do with game development, creating animated pixel sprites, and other indie dev related activities.
So the truth is, this site is just a collection of my ramblings and occasional attempts at creating interesting side projects for myself (and occasionally I actually manage to complete one).

Enjoy!
