My final (for now) pack is available onÂ [gamedevmarket.net](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/rpg-pixel-sprites-mini-folk-2781) 

What does this mean?

Well it means that I now have 4 packs of matching animated sprites available for indie devs to purchase and make use of in their games! That's a total of 12 hand crafted sprites with a retro 8 bit pixelated feel.
