![Unity sumbission]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/unity-heroes.png)  

I've submitted my first pack to the [unity asset store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/). It's the demo scene and prefabs I used in the youtube videos below. It contains my 3 hero animated sprites that can be dragged and dropped into any scene. They can each be controlled as in the video, with walk, attack, jump, hurt, and die animations. The wizard and the ranger also fire some example projectiles, which have collision detection.

If you watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ogrkrw1q7c] closely you'll see that the projectile hit the knight and pushes him around. That's the cool thing about unity and the rigidbody system. You don't really have to do much work and you get some cool physics just start working. You can imagine making a game where you have to knock over blocks, or blast walls out of the way.

One of these days I'll make a demo that includes some of these techniques and ideas.... one day.
