Today both of my last 2 packs were approved on the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/41498)!

That means there are now a total of 4 packs for Unity developers to use to create a retro 8 bit pixelated game. They come with all the spritesheets, prefabs, and mecanim animations ready to go. So you just need to drop them into your game and update the controller code.
