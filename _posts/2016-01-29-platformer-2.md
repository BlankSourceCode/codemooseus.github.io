I just updated my Animated Pixel Pack on the unity asset store:
[https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/43626](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/43626)

Now it is fully compatible with 2d platformer games. Featuring wall hanging, double jumping, one way platforms, water, ice, and much more!

Check out the video below for a demo scene that is included with the asset pack.

You can easily drag and drop the character prefabs into your own tileset platformer and have a great looking pixel game :)
