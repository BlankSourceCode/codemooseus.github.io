Since I got my first submission to [http://gamedevmarket.net](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/rpg-pixel-sprites-mini-heroes-2642/) I thought it would be a good idea to let users see what the animations might look like when they add the sprites to their game.

I've never uploaded anything to youtube before, so I didn't really know where to start. Except the same place everyone starts, which is with a google search. The process seemed pretty easy, setup an account, upload a video, then change around some settings and details for it.

But what to record the video in? After some unsuccessful attempts with several different recording programs, I found [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) which seemed to work pretty well. And best of all its freeeeee.

So after fiddling around with unity and getting my prefabs in order, I uploaded my first ever video to youtube, you can take a look at it below.
